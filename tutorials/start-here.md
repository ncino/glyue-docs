# Start Here

## Beginner Tutorials

The three tutorials presented here are intentionally sequenced, and each tutorial builds on the ones before it.&#x20;

By working through these tutorials, you will learn to navigate Integration Gateway, build, run, and inspect the outputs of integrations, and connect Integration Gateway to external systems.

These skills will provide the foundation for building larger, more complex integrations on Integration Gateway. After you finish these tutorials, we recommend you learn-by-doing, using the extensive collection of How-To Guides and Reference Docs to further extend your abilities.

**Recommended Order of Tutorials:**

1. [**Building a Single-Step Integration**](building-a-single-step-integration/)**:** Learn the basics of navigating Integration Gateway, creating an integration and service requests, and running an integration.
2. [**Building a Multi-System Integration**](building-a-multi-system-integration/)**:** Use the results of the first integration to make changes in a second system, a mock banking core.
3. [**Building an Event-Driven Integration**](building-an-event-driven-integration/)**:** Modify your integration to respond to requests from external systems.&#x20;

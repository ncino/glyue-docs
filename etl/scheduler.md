# Scheduler

Integration Gateway ETL's scheduler operates similarly to [Integration Gateway iPaaS's scheduler](../integration-gateway-platform-reference/integration-scheduler.md).

The only distinction is that due to the _Drafts_ feature in Integration Gateway ETL, the ETL scheduler can only schedule workflows using their _Production_ credentials — _Development_ credentials are not permitted.
